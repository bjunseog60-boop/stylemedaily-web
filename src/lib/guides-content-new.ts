  { heading: 'Why Plus Size Fashion Has Never Been Better', paragraphs: ['The plus size fashion landscape in 2026 is more exciting, diverse, and accessible than at any point in history. Major retailers like ASOS Curve, Eloquii, Torrid, and Universal Standard have expanded their ranges significantly, while Amazon\'s plus size selection has become genuinely competitive on quality and style. The narrative has shifted from \'making do\' to actively celebrating every body type with clothes designed to flatter and excite.', 'The key to building a great plus size wardrobe is understanding which silhouettes work best for your individual proportions rather than following blanket rules. The \'dress for your body type\' conversation in fashion has matured considerably — it\'s less about hiding and more about choosing pieces that make you feel powerful, comfortable, and authentically yourself.'] },
  { heading: 'The Most Flattering Silhouettes for Plus Size Bodies', paragraphs: ['Wrap dresses and tops remain perennially flattering for plus size figures because the diagonal wrap line creates visual interest at the waist while the adjustable closure accommodates fluctuating measurements. Look for wrap styles in fluid fabrics like jersey, crepe, or satin that drape rather than cling.', 'High-waisted bottoms paired with tucked-in or cropped tops create a defined waist and visually elongate the legs. Wide-leg trousers cut from flowing fabrics like linen, georgette, or ponte knit are particularly elegant — they balance broader hips and create a sleek, powerful silhouette from waist to floor.', 'A-line skirts and dresses are universally flattering because they skim the hips and flare gently outward, accommodating curves without adding bulk. The key is finding a quality A-line that starts the flare at the right point on your body — typically at or just below the fullest part of the hip.'] },
  { heading: 'Building a Plus Size Capsule Wardrobe', paragraphs: ['Start with five high-quality basics: a perfectly fitted pair of dark jeans, a structured blazer, a wrap dress, a quality knit top, and a versatile midi skirt. These five pieces can generate dozens of outfit combinations and serve as the foundation for any plus size wardrobe.', 'Invest in great undergarments, as they can transform the way clothes fit. A well-fitted bra that provides adequate support and a smooth seamless shapewear layer under bodycon pieces makes a significant difference to overall appearance. Brands like Soma, Wacoal, and Skims offer excellent options for fuller figures.'] },
  { heading: 'Color and Pattern Tips for Plus Size Dressing', paragraphs: ['Forget the outdated rule that plus size women must wear all-black or avoid patterns. Bold colors and prints can look absolutely stunning when chosen thoughtfully. The key is scale — avoid tiny micro-prints that can read as busy, and instead opt for medium to large-scale prints that complement rather than overwhelm your frame.', 'Vertical stripes and color-blocking can create elongating visual effects, while monochromatic dressing in a single color from head to toe creates a long, unbroken line. Contrast in unexpected places, like a pop of color in shoes or a vibrant bag against a neutral outfit, adds personality without any perceived \'rules\' about color placement.'] },
  { heading: 'Best Affordable Plus Size Brands for 2026', paragraphs: ['Amazon\'s The Drop and Find Clothing lines have significantly improved their plus size offerings through 2026, with well-fitted pieces at accessible price points. The consistently excellent budget-friendly options include ASOS Curve ($25-$80), Eloquii ($40-$120), and Torrid ($30-$100).', 'For investment pieces, consider Universal Standard, which offers size-inclusive basics with an exceptional fit guarantee, and Lane Bryant for structured workwear. Rent the Runway and NUULY subscription services are also excellent for plus size shoppers who want to experiment with higher-end pieces without commitment.'] },

  { heading: 'The Defining Aesthetic of Fall 2026 Fashion', paragraphs: ['Fall 2026 fashion is defined by a sophisticated tension between structure and comfort, nostalgia and modernity. The dominant aesthetic blends quiet luxury minimalism with tactile richness — think buttery leathers, chunky textures, and elevated earth tones rendered in surprisingly relaxed silhouettes.', 'Three major trend threads weave through the season. The first is \'rich minimalism\': investment-quality basics in elevated fabrics with an understated palette of camel, dark chocolate, forest green, and burgundy. The second is \'urban utility\': functional pieces like cargo trousers, quilted vests, and utility jackets reimagined in luxurious materials. The third is \'romantic revival\': lace overlays, velvet textures, and draped evening silhouettes.'] },
  { heading: 'Must-Have Fall 2026 Coats and Outerwear', paragraphs: ['The oversized cocoon coat is the outerwear piece of fall 2026. Cut in camel, charcoal, or deep burgundy wool-blend fabrics, this voluminous shape is elegant enough for the office and relaxed enough for weekends. Labels like Zara, Mango, and H&M Premium have excellent versions in the $100-$200 range.', 'The quilted vest is having a major moment as a versatile layering piece. Worn over a crisp Oxford shirt with tailored trousers, it hits a perfect note between preppy and polished. The knee-length leather coat — either in genuine leather or high-quality faux — is the statement investment piece of the season, appearing at Toteme, The Row, and Arket. Amazon has competitive faux leather alternatives from $65.', 'Blazers continue to be a fall essential, but the fall 2026 version is oversized, often double-breasted, and appears in rich plaids, Glen checks, and Prince of Wales patterns alongside clean solids.'] },
  { heading: 'Fall 2026 Knitwear and Sweaters', paragraphs: ['Knitwear is the soul of fall dressing, and 2026 delivers exceptional options. The chunky cable-knit sweater is essential — look for heavyweight versions in cream, oatmeal, or rust that feel luxurious to the touch. Fisherman-style knits in natural unbleached wool tones are particularly strong this season.', 'The cardigan gets an upgrade this fall, evolving into a structured layer worn as a blazer substitute over trousers or midi skirts. The cropped cardigan paired with high-waisted wide-leg trousers and ankle boots is the season\'s defining casual-chic outfit formula.'] },
  { heading: 'Fall 2026 Bottoms and Footwear', paragraphs: ['Tailored trousers in bold plaids, tweeds, and herringbone patterns replace jeans as the go-to fall bottom for many style-conscious women. High-waisted styles with a slim or straight leg are the most versatile. Cargo trousers in forest green, navy, or khaki with functional pockets offer a more casual alternative.', 'Footwear is where fall 2026 really shines. Knee-high boots in rich brown, cognac, and black leather are essential, while lug-sole ankle boots in platform or combat silhouettes add edge to any look. Ballet flats persist into fall in velvet and patent leather versions that feel distinctly seasonal.'] },
  { heading: 'The Color Palette of Fall 2026', paragraphs: ['Earth tones dominate, but with unexpected depth and saturation. Rich terracotta, deep burgundy, dark forest green, and moody navy provide the season\'s strongest color stories. Camel and various shades of brown from light tan to deep chocolate serve as the essential neutral backdrop.', 'The surprising color story of fall 2026 is the emergence of deep purples — from dusty lavender to rich plum and aubergine. These purple tones pair beautifully with the earth tones and add a romantic edge to the season\'s more structured looks.'] },

'petite-fashion-guide-2026': [
  { heading: 'Understanding Petite Fit: More Than Just Short', paragraphs: ['Petite sizing refers to frames under 5\'4", but the reality is that \'petite\' encompasses a wide range of body proportions. The challenges petite shoppers face vary: shorter torsos, shorter inseams, sleeves that run long, and jackets that hit at unflattering points on the body. The solution isn\'t just to buy smaller sizes — it\'s to understand which cuts, proportions, and styling techniques create an elongated, balanced silhouette.', 'The most important principle in petite dressing is maintaining clean, unbroken vertical lines. Anything that visually cuts the body horizontally — a waistband in a contrasting color, a bold pattern break at the hips, or a coat that ends at the widest point of the figure — will visually shorten the silhouette. Monochromatic outfits, well-chosen heel heights, and strategic use of vertical elements counter this effect.'] },
  { heading: 'The Best Silhouettes for Petite Figures', paragraphs: ['High-waisted bottoms are the single most powerful tool in a petite woman\'s wardrobe. By placing the visual waistline above the natural waist, high-waisted jeans, skirts, and trousers create the illusion of longer legs. Pair with a tucked-in or cropped top to maximize the effect.', 'A-line and fit-and-flare dresses are particularly successful for petite frames because they define the waist and add volume at the skirt — a flattering counterpoint to narrower shoulders and hips. Choose styles that hit at or just above the knee rather than midi or maxi lengths, which can overwhelm a shorter frame.', 'Straight and slim leg trousers in petite inseam lengths are cleaner and more elongating than wide-leg styles for most petite women. If you love wide-leg pants, add height with a substantial heel and tuck in the top fully to preserve the long-line effect.'] },
  { heading: 'Styling Tips That Add Instant Height', paragraphs: ['Wear tops and bottoms in the same or similar tones to create an unbroken vertical line. A navy blouse with navy trousers reads as significantly taller than a white blouse with navy trousers. Add interest through texture rather than contrasting colors.', 'Pointed-toe shoes — whether flats, heels, or boots — create an elongating effect by extending the line of the foot. Round or square-toe shoes visually shorten the foot and by extension the leg. Even a small block heel of 1 to 2 inches can significantly transform proportions without sacrificing comfort.', 'Vertical stripes, subtle vertical seaming, and long pendant necklaces all guide the eye upward and downward rather than across. V-necklines and deep scoop necks add vertical line from chin to chest that elongates the upper body.'] },
  { heading: 'Best Petite Clothing Brands for 2026', paragraphs: ['ASOS Petite has become the gold standard for accessible petite fashion, offering a comprehensive range from casual basics to formal wear in dedicated petite proportions from sizes 0 to 14. Ann Taylor Petite offers excellent workwear with tailored fits, and Old Navy\'s petite range delivers strong basics at low price points.', 'For premium petite fashion, consider Banana Republic Petite, J.Crew Petite, and Club Monaco. For budget options, SHEIN Petite and H&M\'s petite section have improved significantly in 2026 with better-fitted garments designed specifically for shorter proportions.'] },
  { heading: 'What to Avoid in Petite Dressing', paragraphs: ['Avoid oversized silhouettes unless worn very intentionally — an enormous oversized sweater on a petite frame can read as wearing a sack rather than a fashion statement. If you love the oversized trend, anchor it with form-fitting bottoms and visible shoes to preserve definition.', 'Maxi skirts and dresses require heels and careful fabric selection for petite frames. Lightweight, fluid fabrics that drape rather than bulk are much more successful than stiff, structured maxi silhouettes. When in doubt, midi lengths are more universally flattering than maxi for petite women.'] },

The combination of competitive pricing, Prime\'s fast delivery, and an improving curation of both in-house brands and independent sellers has made Amazon one of the most visited fashion destinations in the US.', 'The key to shopping Amazon Fashion successfully is knowing where to look. The platform\'s own labels — The Drop, Find Clothing, Mae, and Daily Ritual — represent some of the best value in online fashion.

Available in a huge color range for $20-$28.', 'The Amazon Essentials Classic-Fit Short-Sleeve Crewneck T-Shirt in 100% cotton is the platonic ideal of a basic white tee — $12 to $18, available in numerous colors, with thousands of positive reviews. The The Drop women\'s oversized satin blouse regularly sells for $25-$30 and photographs beautifully.', 'Ribbed bodysuits from Amazon\'s Verdusa and Daily Ritual brands at $15-$22 have become wardrobe staples for their versatility and quality at the price point. They layer under blazers, tuck into skirts, and stand alone as tops.'] },
  { heading: 'Amazon Prime Fashion Deals $30-$60', paragraphs: ['The ANRABESS women\'s turtleneck sweater has accumulated over 50,000 Amazon reviews for good reason — the ribbed knit fabric is substantial, the turtleneck height is elegant without being constraining, and it comes in an extraordinary range of colors. At $32-$38, it\'s one of the best sweater values online.', 'The The Drop Damaris Wide-Leg Pant is a perennial Amazon fashion favorite — flowing, fluid, and legitimately chic, available in neutrals from $35-$48 depending on fabric choice. The Amazon Essentials Women\'s Classic 5-Pocket Slim-Fit Stretch Jean at $35-$42 is equally beloved for its consistent quality.', 'For footwear, the Dream Pairs women\'s low heels consistently deliver on quality at the $35-$50 price point, with designs that punch above their price.'] },
  { heading: 'How to Find Hidden Gems on Amazon Fashion', paragraphs: ['The key to finding the best Amazon fashion deals is learning to read reviews strategically. Look for verified reviews with photos from real customers rather than the top review. Sort by "Most Helpful" rather than "Top Rated" to find honest assessments that include both positives and critiques.', 'Subscribe and Save can reduce prices on frequently repurchased items by 5-15%. Amazon\'s Prime Wardrobe service allows you to try up to eight items before paying, making it excellent for fit-sensitive categories like jeans and structured tops.'] },

  { heading: 'Redefining Style in Your 50s', paragraphs: ['Fashion in your 50s in 2026 is about radical self-expression rather than following outdated prescriptions about age-appropriate dressing. The women who look best in their 50s are those who have developed a clear point of view about their personal style and dress with intention and confidence rather than self-consciousness.', 'Your 50s often coincide with a period of professional achievement, personal clarity, and financial independence — all of which can be reflected in a wardrobe that feels considered and refined. The shift is less about what you can and can\'t wear and more about investing in quality pieces that will serve you for years rather than chasing fast trends.'] },
  { heading: 'Building an Elevated Wardrobe Foundation', paragraphs: ['Invest in quality basics that fit impeccably. A well-tailored blazer in navy, black, or camel instantly elevates any outfit and reads as polished regardless of what it\'s paired with. Look for structured shoulders, clean lines, and quality fabric construction. This is a piece worth spending $100-$300 on.', 'Dark, perfectly-fitted straight-leg or slim trousers in quality fabric are essential. Avoid overly skinny cuts that can look dated, and avoid excessively wide-leg styles if you\'re not tall. Mid-rise and high-rise waistbands tend to be the most comfortable and flattering options for women over 50.', 'Invest in quality knitwear. A cashmere or cashmere-blend sweater in a neutral color will last decades and photograph beautifully. Good knitwear is one of the clearest signals of quality in a wardrobe, and the tactile experience of wearing beautiful cashmere is worth the investment.'] },
  { heading: 'What to Keep and What to Update', paragraphs: ['Keep any pieces that still fit perfectly, feel great to wear, and represent your authentic style. Fit is the most important factor — an old blazer that fits beautifully will always look better than a new one that doesn\'t. Take investment pieces to a good tailor rather than replacing them.', 'Update pieces that feel dated in silhouette. This typically means extremely skinny jeans from the early 2010s, boxy shapeless tops, and items in very dated print styles. The goal is a wardrobe that looks contemporary without being slavishly trend-driven.'] },
  { heading: 'The Best Outfit Formulas for Women Over 50', paragraphs: ['Formula one: tailored trousers + quality knit top + pointed-toe loafers + structured bag. This combination reads as effortlessly chic in every professional and social context.', 'Formula two: dark jeans + quality blouse + blazer + low heel or white sneaker. This is the most versatile casual-to-smart formula in fashion, working for everything from daytime meetings to dinner out.', 'Formula three: elegant midi dress + quality flat or low heel + minimal jewelry. A well-chosen midi dress does all the styling work for you — it\'s the simplest path to looking polished and sophisticated.'] },
  { heading: 'Beauty and Style Synergies for Women Over 50', paragraphs: ['Hair and makeup interact significantly with clothing choices. Lighter, well-maintained hair (whether natural silver or colored) tends to look best with strong contrast in clothing — bold colors, strong prints, or sharp black-and-white combinations. Hair that lacks definition or volume benefits from softer, more textured fashion choices.', 'Jewelry becomes increasingly important as a style signature in your 50s. Invest in one or two pieces that feel genuinely meaningful — a quality watch, a sculptural ring, or a distinctive necklace.

The best activewear combines technical fabric performance with aesthetic appeal — pieces that look as good walking into the gym as they do during a HIIT session.', 'Fabric technology has advanced significantly in the accessible price range. Four-way stretch fabrics with moisture-wicking properties, anti-odor treatments, and squat-proof opacity are now available from Amazon, Target, and H&M Sport at prices that would have bought much inferior products five years ago.'] },
  { heading: 'Building the Perfect Gym Outfit by Workout Type', paragraphs: ['For weight training, the ideal outfit prioritizes freedom of movement and a silhouette that allows you to check form in the mirror. High-waisted compression leggings with a moisture-wicking sports bra or fitted tank top is the gold standard. The Lululemon Align legging remains the benchmark, but Amazon\'s AUROLA and HALARA brands deliver 80% of the performance at 40% of the price.', 'For cardio and running, lightweight and highly breathable fabrics are essential. Running shorts in 2026\'s preferred 3-5 inch inseam, a high-impact sports bra with excellent support, and a moisture-wicking tank or light jacket are the key components. For outdoor running, a reflective element and UV protection are important considerations.', 'For yoga and Pilates, softness, stretch, and clean lines matter most. Buttery-soft high-waist leggings, a supportive but not restrictive sports bra, and a loose-fitting crop top layer create the perfect yoga ensemble. Non-slip grip socks are an often-overlooked essential for mat-based classes.'] },

Amazon\'s own Core 10 line offers slightly more technical fabrics for similar prices.', 'Old Navy Active, Target\'s All in Motion line, and Walmart\'s No Boundaries active range provide excellent budget options at $15-$35.

A convertible bag that works as a backpack and a tote provides maximum versatility.', 'Essential gym bag contents: a quality microfiber towel, deodorant, a reusable water bottle, resistance bands for warm-up, wireless earbuds with good sweat resistance, and a small organizer bag for valuables.

Building a vacation wardrobe around a coherent color palette — typically two neutrals, two patterns or accent colors — ensures everything pairs effortlessly and you never stand in front of your suitcase feeling like you have nothing to wear.', 'The seven-day vacation formula: pack five to seven bottoms, five to eight tops, two to three dresses, one pair of sandals, one pair of sneakers or casual shoes, one pair of dressier shoes, and one versatile cover-up or jacket. Add a swimsuit (or two) and a beach bag. This approach creates around 30+ outfit combinations.'] },
  { heading: 'Beach and Resort Vacation Outfits', paragraphs: ['The beach vacation outfit formula centers on easy layers over swimwear — a linen or cotton shirt dress as a cover-up works both on the sand and for casual beach-town dinners. A good swimsuit is the foundation: look for flattering cuts that provide the coverage and support you need, whether that\'s a classic one-piece, a stylish high-waist bikini, or a bandeau two-piece.', 'Resort style in 2026 leans toward vibrant colors and bold prints — hibiscus florals, abstract tie-dyes, and geometric patterns in saturated tropical tones. A sarong or pareo serves as an outfit accelerator: wrapped as a skirt over a bikini, draped as a shawl at an open-air restaurant, or folded as a beach blanket.', 'Footwear should be minimal and durable. A pair of leather or leather-look flat sandals that can handle both sand and cobblestones is essential. A pair of espadrilles or platform sandals adds height for evenings.'] },
  { heading: 'City and Urban Vacation Outfits', paragraphs: ['City vacations demand outfits that are stylish, comfortable for walking, and appropriate across diverse settings — from major tourist attractions to nice restaurants to casual cafes. The formula: straight-leg jeans or tailored trousers paired with comfortable sneakers or walking shoes for day, elevated with a midi dress and sandals for evenings.', 'Layering is essential for city vacations where temperatures vary between air-conditioned museums, shaded streets, and sunny plazas. A lightweight denim or linen jacket that fits in your bag is invaluable. A silk or synthetic scarf serves as a fashion accessory, makeshift blanket, and shoulder cover for visiting religious sites.'] },
  { heading: 'What to Wear at Your Vacation Destination', paragraphs: ['Research local dress codes before you travel. Many beach towns have become more relaxed about resort wear in restaurants, but European cities and religious sites have stricter standards. Packing a lightweight cardigan or blouse that covers shoulders eliminates any access issues at churches, mosques, and temples.', 'Consider the specific activities planned when building your vacation wardrobe. A hiking day requires proper trail footwear and moisture-wicking clothes; a cooking class calls for comfortable, non-precious clothes; a yacht excursion demands non-slip soles and wind-resistant layers.'] },

Jersey, crepe, and linen actually improve with a little relaxed draping.

A product can go from obscure to sold-out globally in 48 hours when a video goes viral — creating a fashion ecosystem that operates at unprecedented speed. But beyond the viral moments, TikTok has also fostered longer-lasting aesthetic communities that represent genuine shifts in how people dress.', 'The dominant TikTok fashion communities in 2026 include quiet luxury, coastal grandmother, coquette, dark academia, cottagecore, and Y2K revival. Each represents a distinct aesthetic identity that followers invest in over time, making them more sustainable style influences than simple trend cycles.'] },
  { heading: 'Quiet Luxury and Old Money Aesthetic', paragraphs: ['Quiet luxury — the art of looking expensive without obvious logos — continues to be one of TikTok\'s most enduring fashion influences. The aesthetic prioritizes neutral tones, exceptional fabric quality, and restrained design. Think cream cashmere, perfectly tailored beige trousers, and understated leather goods.', 'Dupes and affordable alternatives have democratized quiet luxury significantly. Amazon and SHEIN both offer convincing versions of the core quiet luxury pieces — structured blazers in sand or camel, wide-leg trousers in quality ponte fabric, and minimalist leather bags at $30-$60 that photograph with the same elegant restraint as their thousand-dollar counterparts.'] },
  { heading: 'Balletcore and Coquette Fashion', paragraphs: ['Balletcore took TikTok by storm in 2025 and continues strongly into 2026, bringing soft tulle skirts, ballet flats, and pastel knitwear into mainstream fashion. The key balletcore pieces: a satin or mesh ballet skirt, a wrap cardigan, a fitted ribbed top, and a pair of ribbon-tied ballet flats.', 'The coquette aesthetic overlaps with balletcore but adds a more explicitly feminine and slightly provocative edge — incorporating bows, lace, and corset elements. The coquette outfit formula: a corset top or boned bodice, a mini or micro-mini skirt, lace-trimmed socks, and Mary Jane shoes. This aesthetic works best when balanced with more casual or minimalist elements to avoid costume territory.'] },
  { heading: 'Dark Academia and Cottagecore', paragraphs: ['Dark academia remains one of TikTok\'s most cohesive fashion aesthetics, drawing inspiration from Ivy League universities, Gothic architecture, and literary culture. The palette is deep and moody — charcoal, burgundy, forest green, deep navy, and warm brown. Key pieces include plaid blazers, Oxford shirts, pleated trousers, argyle knitwear, and loafers.', 'Cottagecore offers the softer, more pastoral counterpoint to dark academia\'s urban intellectualism. Floral prairie dresses, linen aprons, crochet tops, cottage-stripe fabrics, and Mary Jane shoes are the aesthetic\'s signature pieces. The color palette is warm and desaturated — dusty rose, sage green, butter yellow, and antique white.'] },
  { heading: 'How to Incorporate TikTok Trends Authentically', paragraphs: ['The best approach to TikTok fashion trends is extracting one or two elements that genuinely appeal to you and integrating them into your existing style rather than wholesale adopting an entire aesthetic. A single ballet flat, one pair of barrel-leg jeans, or a quiet luxury blazer can subtly update your look without abandoning your personal style identity.', 'Consider the longevity of a trend before investing. Aesthetics that have established communities on TikTok — quiet luxury, dark academia, cottagecore — tend to persist for two to three years rather than the six-week life of a purely viral moment. Investing in aesthetic pieces with staying power makes more financial sense than chasing micro-trends.'] },

The key to the oversized blazer\'s versatility is its inherent contradiction: it\'s structured yet relaxed, formal yet casual, and it adapts to virtually any situation with the right companions.', 'The perfect oversized blazer for 2026 hits at mid-thigh or longer, has lightly padded or structured shoulders, and falls open rather than buttoning tightly. The ideal fabrics are wool blends for autumn and winter, linen and cotton for spring and summer, and ponte knit year-round for its wrinkle-resistance and easy care.'] },

The most accessible entry point to oversized blazer styling — incredibly wearable for everything from running errands to casual meetings.', 'Outfit 3: Oversized blazer worn as a dress over a bodysuit + thigh-high boots. This more fashion-forward approach works best with a longer-length blazer (below mid-thigh) in a clean neutral. The boots elongate the leg and anchor the look.', 'Outfit 4: Oversized blazer + slip dress underneath + barely-there sandals. A floaty slip dress under a structured blazer creates beautiful textural contrast — the fluid, slinky fabric of the dress plays against the architecture of the blazer.', 'Outfit 5: Oversized blazer + pleated midi skirt + ballet flats.

An elevated evening look that plays with volume — two large-scale pieces (the blazer and wide-leg trousers) balanced with the minimalism of a thin-strap camisole.', 'Outfit 8: Oversized blazer + tailored shorts + loafers. The blazer-and-shorts combination walks a perfect line between polished and effortless — particularly effective in summer and spring with linen or cotton blazers.', 'Outfit 9: Oversized blazer + knit turtleneck + slim trousers + ankle boots. A cozy but polished cold-weather formula that layers texture effectively. Choose a blazer in a pattern like plaid or houndstooth for extra visual interest.', 'Outfit 10: Oversized blazer + corset top + flared trousers + platform heels. A more dressed-up, fashion-forward look that works beautifully for dinner events and creative professional settings.'] },

A monochromatic neutral summer look that\'s unexpectedly chic in its simplicity. This formula photographs beautifully and feels effortlessly sophisticated.', 'Outfit 13: Oversized blazer + bandeau top + tailored trousers + mule heels.

Buy a blazer where the shoulders extend slightly beyond your natural shoulder line (by half an inch to an inch), the chest closes without pulling, and the sleeves can be worn as-is or rolled.', 'For most women, a size up from your usual works well.

  { heading: 'The Best Wedding Guest Dresses $50-$100', paragraphs: ['Azazie, a US-based bridesmaid and formal wear brand, offers elegant wedding guest dresses at $60-$100 with custom sizing options — a game-changer for finding a flattering fit.

  { heading: 'Dress Codes Decoded: What to Wear for Each', paragraphs: ['Black tie: A floor-length or formal tea-length gown is appropriate. Stick to rich, luxurious fabrics — satin, velvet, chiffon, lace. For black tie optional, a dressy midi or full-length dress in an elegant fabric (not casual cotton) works well alongside or instead of a full gown.', 'Cocktail attire: A midi dress hitting at or above the knee, or a chic separates combination of tailored trousers and a silk blouse with a blazer, fits perfectly. Shoes should have a heel — block heel, kitten heel, or strappy sandal.', 'Garden or outdoor casual: This is the most forgiving dress code and allows for flowing midi dresses, elegant sundresses, and even well-chosen jumpsuits. Flat sandals and espadrilles are appropriate footwear. Avoid stiletto heels that will sink into grass.'] },

A pair of quality earrings in pearl, crystal, or polished metal adds immediate elegance. A satin or beaded clutch completes the formal requirement without adding bulk.', 'Consider wearing a wrap, bolero, or elegant blazer that can be removed for dancing — churches and air-conditioned venues often feel cold, while outdoor receptions can be warm. A pashmina or faux-fur stole for colder months adds drama and warmth simultaneously.', 'Shoes are critical: they need to work for standing, dancing, and walking on various surfaces. A block heel or wedge offers much more stability than a stiletto for grass or uneven outdoor surfaces, while still dressing up the look appropriately.'] },
